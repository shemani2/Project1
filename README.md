# Description
This project utilizes Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to generate tables and figures from salaries of data science from 2020 to 2023. In the field of data science that is rapidly evolving, understanding the dataset of salaries from different job titles and trends will be beneficial for those in interests of the data science community. By using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib we are able to answer:
1.	Comparison of different experience levels of a position under the same job title and the salary they earn
2.	Mean, median, mode statistics for the different top 5 job titles in the data science community
3.	Trend of how a position has changed in demand over time and predicting the salaries of the future of each job titles
4.	Does work environment (hybrid, on-site, and remote) impact on salary?

# Describing the Datasets
This dataset is a CSV file that encompasses a collection of data science salary from 2020 to 2024, however we are ommitting year 2024. In this dataset, not only salaries are collected but the details of each job titles and their location, experience level, company size, and work models.

# Analysis
Work Environments
- The job titles we had observed in the top 5 job titles (data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, analytics engineers, and machine learning engineers) showed there is no statistical difference in salaries and work environments.
