#Research Questions to Answer:
#1.	Comparison of different experience levels of a position under the same title (salary they earn)
#2.	Mean, median, mode statistics for the different titles (with visualization)
#3.	Trend of how a position has changed in demand over time (prediction of how useful it will be in the future)
#4.	Work environment = hybrid, onsite, remote (how does this impact salary?)

# Description
This project utilizes Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to generate tables and figures from salaries of data science from 2020 to 2023. In the field of data science that is rapidly evolving, understanding the dataset of salaries from different job titles and trends will be beneficial for those in interests of the data science community. By using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib we are able to answer:
1.	Comparison of different experience levels of a position under the same job title and the salary they earn
2.	Mean, median, mode statistics for the different top 5 job titles in the data science community
3.	Trend of how a position has changed in demand over time and predicting the salaries of the future of each job titles
4.	Does work environment (hybrid, on-site, and remote) impact on salary?

# Dataset Citation 
- [Data Science Salaries 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/data-science-salaries)

# Analysis
Work Environments
- The job titles we had observed in the top 5 job titles (data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, analytics engineers, and machine learning engineers) showed there is no statistical difference in salaries and work enviornments.
